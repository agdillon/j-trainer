After logging in, you will go to the category select screen.  Choose a category, which will take you to the questions screen.  You will be given 5 questions from each category.  Answers must match exactly (some small things are accounted for, such as "the"/"a"/"an", capitalization, and "What is"/"Who is", but unlike in the real show, you cannot identify a person only by their last name).  You will then be able to return to the same categories screen as before and choose another, or choose to load a new set of categories.  The app will keep track of how many questions you get right and wrong, which you can view on the Statistics page.  You also may switch users on the Statistics page.
